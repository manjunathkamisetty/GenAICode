# ### Build a Simple Workflow or Graph Using LangGraph
# 
# #### State
# First, define the State of the graph.
# 
# The State schema serves as the input schema for all Nodes and Edges in the graph.
# 
# Let's use the TypedDict class from python's typing module as our schema, which provides type hints for the keys.

# %%
from typing_extensions import TypedDict
class State(TypedDict):
    graph_info:str

# %% [markdown]
# #### Nodes
# Nodes are just python functions.
# 
# The first positional argument is the state, as defined above.
# 
# Because the state is a TypedDict with schema as defined above, each node can access the key, graph_state, with state['graph_state'].
# 
# Each node returns a new value of the state key graph_state.
# 
# By default, the new value returned by each node will override the prior state value.

# %%
def start_play(state:State):
    print("Start_Play node has been called")
    return {"graph_info":state['graph_info'] + " I am planning to play"}

def cricket(state:State):
    print("My Cricket node has been called")
    return {"graph_info":state['graph_info'] + " Cricket"}

def badminton(state:State):
    print("My badminton node has been called")
    return {"graph_info":state['graph_info'] + " Badminton"}

# %%
import random
from typing import Literal

def random_play(state:State)-> Literal['cricket','badminton']:
    graph_info=state['graph_info']

    if random.random()>0.5:
        return "cricket"
    else:
        return "badminton"

# %% [markdown]
# #### Graph Construction
# Now, we build the graph from our components defined above.
# 
# The StateGraph class is the graph class that we can use.
# 
# First, we initialize a StateGraph with the State class we defined above.
# 
# Then, we add our nodes and edges.
# 
# We use the START Node, a special node that sends user input to the graph, to indicate where to start our graph.
# 
# The END Node is a special node that represents a terminal node.
# 
# Finally, we compile our graph to perform a few basic checks on the graph structure.
# 
# We can visualize the graph as a Mermaid diagram.

# %%
from IPython.display import Image,display
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph,START,END

## Build Graph
graph=StateGraph(State)

## Adding the nodes
graph.add_node("start_play",start_play)
graph.add_node("cricket",cricket)
graph.add_node("badminton",badminton)

## Schedule the flow of the graph

graph.add_edge(START,"start_play")
graph.add_conditional_edges("start_play",random_play)
graph.add_edge("cricket",END)
graph.add_edge("badminton",END)

## Compile the graph
graph_builder=graph.compile()

## View
display(Image(graph_builder.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))

# %% [markdown]
# ### GRAPH Invocation

# %%
graph_builder.invoke({"graph_info":"Hey My name is Krish"})
